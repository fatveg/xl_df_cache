# xl-df-cache

A utility class `XlDfCache` for caching pandas results, and later writing them to an Excel workbook, one sheet per Series or DataFrame.

Useful for collecting intermediate results when performing data science tasks, especially in a notebook or in code with automation (DataFrames created in loops etc.)

See notebook `example_notebook.ipynb`, which creates `example.xlsx`
